</p>
<p>Since the inception of <a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear</a> I've received many wholesome emails about the platform. I've decided to compile a list of these to revisit whenever I feel demotivated.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="09-october-2023-abhi">09 October, 2023 - Abhi</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You have created a writer's dream. I can't tell you the number of people I have already recommended it to. The simplicity of the platform is admirable and inspiring. And I can imagine the complexity of work that you would've put in to bring this simplicity to life.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="27-september-2023-mark">27 September, 2023 - Mark</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for all that you do with Bear Blog. Over the past few days, I have read so many interesting & lovely posts on the discover feed. I've also read several of yours and found them to be very insightful.<br/>
I now have a place write my more personal thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="30-august-2023-peter">30 August, 2023 - Peter</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm really impressed by what you‚Äôre doing with Bearblog‚Äîdefinitely going to take the platform for a spin. In particular, I think the discover feature is brilliantly executed. What also stands out to me is the sheer performance and clean, lightweight nature of the service. It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air amongst a web full of so many bloated websites these days.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="23-august-2023-hazy">23 August, 2023 - Hazy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing a valuable service that has been lacking - a blog that really feels like your own personal website, not just a profile. :) I like how the blog actually feels like my blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="21-august-2023-maurice">21 August, 2023 - Maurice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry for the random DM but I had been going back and forth in my mind about spinning up a blog and what template/framework/cms/whatever-tech to use and then decided to try out Bear blog üòÑ So damn happy I did too! I wanted something straight forward for myself and this is honestly perfect
Hopefully I end up doing some more writing ü§û
Just wanted to drop a message to say hello and thanks for building it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="19-june-2023-timo">19 June, 2023 - Timo</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep up the great work, Herman. You are providing something really unique and helping build a better Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="17-may-2023-derek">17 May, 2023 - Derek</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Love Bear Blog. It's what got me going from talking about blogging to actually doing it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="14-may-2023-andrew">14 May, 2023 - Andrew</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>thanks for making a cool thing and putting it online. i've found a lot of value in journaling myself, and i appreciate when i come across someone like you making stuff and blogging, without sweating the "SEO and social media" angles of it all. props and keep up the good work!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="17-january-2023-jason">17 January, 2023 - Jason</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I needed a quick and easy blog to publish notes to and decided to try out Bear Blog. I usually use a Kirby CMS that I self-host but had trouble logging in on my phone. Since I needed to post something immediately I signed up with Bear and got my blog up. I love the markdown based editor and how quickly everything loads. I‚Äôm totally on board with a tiny internet so I‚Äôm glad this exists. I don‚Äôt have any critiques. Thanks for creating Bear Blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="30-november-2022-jay">30 November, 2022 - Jay</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the platform you've created. I love the philosophy behind it and it really resonates with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="24-november-2022-david">24 November, 2022 - David</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love the simplicity and beauty of the system. You're building something really amazing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="21-november-2022-marc">21 November, 2022 - Marc</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bearblog is exactly the minimalist tool I was searching for. Thanks for providing it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="19-november-2022-seb">19 November, 2022 - Seb</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to say thanks for making and continuing to work on Bear ‚Äì I don't have a blog (yet), but just as a reader it's such a breath of fresh air compared to most of the internet. You really are making the web a nicer place to be :)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="14-november-2022-jyotsna">14 November, 2022 - Jyotsna</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I resonate with your ideology and the intentions you have with Bear. Thank you for making some space for me in your garden.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="9-october-2022-patrick">9 October, 2022 - Patrick</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I would just like to thank you for your work on Bear blog. Its minimal, text-focused approach makes a nice change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="5-september-2022-jonathan">5 September, 2022 - Jonathan</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for developing Bear Blog. I really like the simplicity and minimal approach that foregrounds blog content over design tricks. It is a very refreshing approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="25-august-2022-aravind">25 August, 2022 - Aravind</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bear feels like meeting a long-lost friend.. or a part of myself that I missed for about a decade. I feel at home reading posts on Bear. It's very cozy, it's warm, it feels like curling up with a book on a rainy day. It feels like sanctuary where there is a beautiful silence but with a spirit of life and love filling the air. Thank you, Herman.</p>

<h3 id="19-august-2022-dario">19 August, 2022 - Dario</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for building such a cool platform!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="13-july-2022-julian">13 July, 2022 - Julian</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to send you a quick email because I really love Bearblog! I recently created a blog on it and donated and I've really been loving the experience. The simplicity of using it and the UI are great. I love the feel of it and it seems to have a great community around it too. I tried making a blog with wordpress before but found it too complicated and bloated. Your platform is amazing and I love the feel and character of it. Great job!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="9-july-2022-daft-chuck">9 July, 2022 - Daft Chuck</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been lurking on Bear Blog quite a bit, and I've developed an appreciation for it. I really like what you're doing with it. Thank you for keeping Bear free! Keep up the good work! You know this better than I do, but Bear has already developed its own culture. The blank slate of the platform enables people to express their true selves in a way I haven't seen before. I see longer and higher quality posts mixed in with daily status updates that are four sentences long yet still manage to have meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-may-2022-bob">6 May, 2022 - Bob</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to say that I've just started playing around with Bear Blog, and it's so much of what I have been looking for (in that it's the perfect amount of little). I've been blogging since the early 00s and this is what I've been looking for ever since I stopped back in 2015. And, <em>thank you</em> for markdown!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="7-march-2022-jakub">7 March, 2022 - Jakub</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently came across bearblog.dev and let me be honest - it is super awesome! I used to use WordPress and found out that there are other solutions like bearblog.dev and writefreely.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="20-november-2021-william">20 November, 2021 - William</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve just found and started using bear blog. Well done. I was looking for something simple (without going back to coding my own separate HTML pages) yet flexible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-july-2021-victor">2 July, 2021 - Victor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope this email finds you. Recently started using Bear blog, it is an awesome product. I am a student from a village in India, the internet speed is a bit slow, but bear blog is fast, it is simple and easy to use. Keep up the good work Herman!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="26-june-2021-dirk">26 June, 2021 - Dirk</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for such a great product - your passion for it is inspiring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="16-april-2021-sean">16 April, 2021 - Sean</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I was on StumblingOn, came across Bear through it and love it. I got stunted on hobbies months ago because of mental issues and seeing your constant flow of journals and projects you make is so inspiring.</p>
